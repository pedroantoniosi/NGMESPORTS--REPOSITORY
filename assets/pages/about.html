                    <p class="card__caption--text">NGM Virtual Racing Team was founded in 2010 by New Generation Mobile, with a vision to create a
                        competitive virtual racing team
                        that would dominate the fast-growing world of eSports. Combining cutting-edge technology and a passion
                        for motorsport, NGM eSports quickly made its mark in the virtual racing scene. The team’s creation was
                        driven by the belief that the future of racing was not only on the track but also in the digital world.

                <p class="card__caption--text">Over the years, NGM eSports has competed in some of the most prestigious virtual racing leagues across
                    the globe, earning a reputation as one of the leading teams in the industry. From high-speed circuits to
                    grueling endurance events, NGM eSports raced in nearly every major online competition. Notably, the team
                    achieved remarkable success in the IndyCar e-Championship, winning the title twice and cementing their
                    place as one of the top virtual racing teams.</p>
                <p class="card__caption--text">Their rise to prominence was fueled by a talented roster of drivers, cutting-edge racing simulators, and
                    a strategic approach that balanced speed with precision. As the team gained more recognition, it became
                    a symbol of excellence in virtual motorsport.</p>

                        <p class="card__caption--text">Despite their dominance, NGM eSports made the difficult decision to step away from virtual racing for a
                            period of time. In 2019, after a decade of intense competition, the team chose to take a break from the
                            virtual racing scene to refocus and explore new opportunities. The departure marked the end of an era,
                            but it also set the stage for a new chapter in the team’s history.</p>

                            of the eSports racing world. With new talent, state-of-the-art technology, and the same competitive
                            drive that first defined them, NGM eSports is poised to continue its legacy of excellence in the world
